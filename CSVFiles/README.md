CSV Translator takes a text file in CSV format as input. It creates a list of all the records in the form of 'key: value' and prints it. 

This program is written in Python 3.8 and developed in PyCharm. It imports csv. Its time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of records stored in the file.

To run the program:

Clone or download the repository on your computer. Replace the placeholder data in 'csv_file.txt' with your own csv file. Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. Navigate to the folder containing the program on terminal. Execute using the command 'python Project/main.py <file_location/file_name.txt>'.

Thank you for using CSV Translator!
