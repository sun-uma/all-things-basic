New Application is a program that takes in name, age, gender, salary, city and state as inputs from the user and stores it in seperate variables. It performs basic validation, such as not allowing special characters in strings or negative values for age and salary.

It is written in Python 3.8 and developed in PyCharm. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the largest string entered by the user.

To run the program:

Clone the repository or download the Project folder on your computer. Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. Navigate to the folder containing the program on terminal. Execute using the command 'python Project/main.py'.

Thank you for using New Application!
