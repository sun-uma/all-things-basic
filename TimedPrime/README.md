Timed Prime is a program that prints all the prime number in ascending order with a delay of 5 seconds between each number.

It is written in Python 3.8 and developed in Pycharm. It imports time and random libraries. The time complexity is O(n*k*log^3(n)) where k denotes the accuracy of every printed number being prime and n denotes the prime number.

To run the program:

Clone or download the repository on your computer. Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. Navigate to the folder containing the program on terminal. Execute using the command 'python Project/main.py'.
