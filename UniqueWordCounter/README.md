Unique Word Counter takes a text file as input. It creates an output text file containing a list of all the unique words present in the input file. The words are arranged in ascending order based on length, and the length is appended to the end of each word.

This program is written in Python 3.8 and developed in PyCharm. It imports regex re. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is all the words contained in the input file.

To run the program:

Clone the repository or download the Project folder on your computer. Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. Navigate to the folder containing the program on terminal. Execute using the command 'python Project/main.py <file_location/file_name.txt>'.

The output will appear in a new text file called 'output.txt'. It can be found inside the Project folder, along with main.py.

Thanks for using Unique Word Counter!
