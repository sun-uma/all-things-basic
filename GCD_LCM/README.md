GCD LCM is a program to find either the greatest common factor or the least common multiple of two numbers. It takes two numbers as input from the command line. It asks the user for option between HCF and LCM, then prints the desired output.

This program is written in Python 3.8 and developed using PyCharm. It imports sys library for taking input from console. Its time complexity is O(n) where n is the smallest of both numbers.

To run the program:

Clone the repository or download the Project folder on your computer. Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. Navigate to the folder containing the program on terminal. Execute using the command 'python Project/main.py <number 1> <number 2>'.

The output will be printed in the next line.

Thanks for using GCD LCM!
